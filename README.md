# enetlognke

enetlognke is an OSX NKE (network kernel extension) that demonstrates the interface filter KPI (kernel programming interface). It has two different features:

* it will log packets being transferred via the interface

* it can, optionally, delay packets being transferred via the interface

See the Read Me.txt file for instructions.


This is a copy of Apple's enetlognke (https://developer.apple.com/library/content/samplecode/enetlognke/Introduction/Intro.html). 
Made copy because (1) Apple does not provide all required files, eg xcode files are missing (2) the code does not work 100% on Sierra.

This project has the code signing turned off. You can turn it on in the Build Settings if necessary.
